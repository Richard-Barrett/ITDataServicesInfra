## Packages
This area is to track any and all changes made with the [Chocolatey Package Manager]() as a result, there are three area here that focus on Developer Builds, Local Builds, and Server Builds. 
Furthermore, there is an option here to help organize security for packages on the [Chocolatey Package Manager Website]() that checks for specific vulnerabilities for packages you may wish to install. 
The default scripts here will install all packages listed in the specific package file by default. 
If you wish to install a package one at a time you do the following to help you install packages one at a time:

**Get Help Instructions Similar to a Man Page**
- **`<choco --help`** or **`choco -h`**

**Install a Package with Prompt to Install**
- **`choco install <package>`**

**Install a Package without a Prompt to Install**
- **`choco install <package> -y`**

**NOTE: THE SCRIPTS IN THIS DIRECTORY INSTALL ALL PACKAGES RESPECTIVE TO THE FILE DEVELOPER, LOCAL, AND SERVER**
