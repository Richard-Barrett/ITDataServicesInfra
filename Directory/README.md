# Directory

This directory is specifically a database repository that is managed by ITDataServicesInfra with information scraped from the web. 
It allows people to interact with any and/all state schools for public contact information, website links, and distrcit contacts.
This section will also incorporate a method to use it as an internal Database for every school in every state in the Unites States.
Furthermore, this area will also help to gather international contacts and University Data as well as current contact information that can be scraped.
